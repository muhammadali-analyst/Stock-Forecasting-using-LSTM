LSTM Model – Stock Prediction Project

A data science project demonstrating prediction using an LSTM neural network, fully built and trained in Google Colab.

📌 Overview

This project showcases how to build, train, and evaluate an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model using Python in Google Colab.
It covers the complete workflow — from data preprocessing to visualization of predictions — making it a solid portfolio piece for machine learning and deep learning roles.

The notebook includes:

Dataset loading & cleaning

Feature scaling

LSTM model architecture

Training and validation

Prediction & visualization

Saving the model

🚀 Features

End-to-end LSTM implementation in Google Colab

Time-series preprocessing and sequence creation

Train/validation split for reliable model evaluation

Model training with loss-curve visualization

Prediction graph comparing Actual vs Predicted

Easy-to-modify structure for other time-series datasets

🧰 Tech Stack

Python 3

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib

Google Colab (GPU runtime)

📊 Model Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing
