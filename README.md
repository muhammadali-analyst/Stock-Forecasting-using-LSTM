LSTM Model 
A deep-learning project demonstrating sequence prediction using an LSTM neural network, fully built and trained in Google Colab.

📌 Overview
This project showcases how to build, train, and evaluate an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model using Python in Google Colab.
It covers the complete workflow—from data preprocessing to visualization of predictions—making it a solid portfolio piece for machine learning and deep learning roles.

The notebook includes:
Dataset loading & cleaning
Feature scaling
LSTM model architecture
Training and validation
Prediction & visualizatio
Saving the model

🚀 Features
End-to-end LSTM implementation in Google Colab
Time-series preprocessing and sequence creation
Train/validation split for reliable testing
Model training with clear loss visualization
Prediction graph comparing Actual vs Predicted
Easy-to-modify structure for other datasets

🧰 Tech Stack
Python 3
TensorFlow / Keras
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Google Colab GPU runtime

📊 Model Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing
Handling missing values
Feature scaling using MinMaxScaler
Creating sequential timesteps for LSTM input

📈 Results
The notebook includes:
